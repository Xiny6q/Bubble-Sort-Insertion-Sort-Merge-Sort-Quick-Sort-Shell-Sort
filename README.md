Description:

You will write a program which implements the following sorts and compares the performance for operations on arrays of integers

of growing sizes 10, 100, 1000, 5000, 10000, 25000, etc….

You will graph the performance of the different sorts as a function of the size of the array.

1)BubbleSort

2)InsertionSort

3)MergeSort

4)Non-Recursive, one extra array MergeSort (We’ll call this improved version, IterativeMergeSort from here on out in this homework)

5)QuickSort
